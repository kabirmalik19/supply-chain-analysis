Supply Chain Management Dashboard

This project presents a comprehensive, end-to-end analysis of supply chain operations using Python, Power BI, and SQL. The dashboard provides actionable insights into inventory, orders, suppliers, warehouses, and shipments to support strategic decision-making.

ðŸ“Œ Objective

To build a dynamic and interactive dashboard that provides complete visibility into supply chain performance and helps identify operational inefficiencies across multiple dimensions.

ðŸ”§ Tools & Technologies

Python (Pandas) â€“ Data cleaning, transformation, and preparation

Power BI â€“ Data visualization, dashboard design, DAX measures

SQL â€“ Data querying for real-time reporting and dashboard integration

ðŸ—‚ Project Components
1. Python Notebook (Untitled7.ipynb)

Removed null values and standardized formats

Filled missing values using top 5 frequent values

Performed ABC Analysis to categorize products by revenue contribution:

Category A: Top ~20% products contributing ~70â€“80% of the revenue

Category B: Next ~30% products contributing ~15â€“25%

Category C: Remaining ~50% with low cumulative value impact

Merged and prepared datasets for dashboard integration

2. SQL Queries (supply_chain_analysis_sql.sql)

Includes queries such as:

Total orders per product

Out-of-stock products

Orders fulfilled by each warehouse

Stock replenishment frequency

Top 5 most ordered products

Current stock levels and shipment counts

3. Power BI Dashboard (power_bi_supply_chain_project_main.pbix)

Visual reports include:

Inventory Report â€“ Overstock/understock tracking

Warehouse Report â€“ Utilization percentages

Supplier Report â€“ Reliability, shipment contribution

Product Report â€“ Fast/slow movers, ABC categorized products, top sellers

Order Report â€“ Fulfillment times, trends

Executive Summary â€“ Key metrics across the supply chain

4. Presentation (Supply Chain Management Dashb___.pptx)

Summarizes the project scope, workflow, tools used, ABC insights, key performance indicators, and future enhancements. Designed for stakeholder communication and project documentation.

ðŸ“Š Key Insights

95% of orders are fulfilled

7 products repeatedly went out of stock

3 warehouses are operating below 50% capacity

Top 5 suppliers contribute to 72% of shipments

On-time delivery rate is 91%

Starter Motor 752 is the most ordered product (3,200 units in the last 3 months)

Category A products account for over 75% of total order value, aiding focused inventory control

ðŸ”„ Future Enhancements

Integrate live SQL connections for real-time insights

Add ML-driven demand forecasting models

Mobile-optimized dashboard layout

Real-time stockout alert system

Scheduled refresh automation for Power BI dashboards
